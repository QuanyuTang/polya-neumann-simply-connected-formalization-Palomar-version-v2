# The boundary of a simply connected Lipschitz domain is connected

Let `Ω` be a bounded simply connected Lipschitz domain.

* For `z ∉ Ω̄`, the function `w ↦ w - z` has a continuous logarithm on `Ω` (lifting through the
  covering map `exp`, which uses simple connectivity), and this logarithm extends continuously to
  `Ω̄`, because near a boundary point `Ω` is the connected region above a Lipschitz graph
  (`exists_log_closure`). Hence every closed Lipschitz curve in `Ω̄` has winding number `0` about
  every point outside `Ω̄` (`windingNumber_eq_zero_of_lift`).
* A Lipschitz Jordan loop `γ` contained in `∂Ω` (from the boundary walk) separates a point of `Ω`
  from a point outside `Ω̄` near one of its points: the winding numbers differ by the jump `±1`
  (`exists_windingNumber_ne_of_frontier`).
* If `∂Ω` had a point `q` off the loop, then near `q` there would be both points of `Ω` and points
  outside `Ω̄` in a disc missing the loop, so the winding number of the loop would be `0` on `Ω`,
  contradicting the jump. Hence the loop is all of `∂Ω`, and `∂Ω` is connected
  (`isPreconnected_frontier_of_simplyConnected`).
