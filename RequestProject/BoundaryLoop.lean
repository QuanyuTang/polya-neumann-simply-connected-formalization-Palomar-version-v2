# The boundary walk closes up into a Lipschitz Jordan curve

For a bounded Lipschitz domain, the boundary walk (`walk`) eventually revisits a point
(`WalkData.exists_pair`, by compactness of `∂Ω`), hence returns to its starting point
(`WalkData.exists_return`, by backward uniqueness of the walk, which comes from consistency of
orientation). Stopping at the first return gives a closed Lipschitz curve, injective before the
return (`WalkData.exists_loop`), whose image is open and closed in `∂Ω`
(`WalkData.image_eq`). Hence, when `∂Ω` is connected, it is a single Lipschitz Jordan curve
(`exists_jordanParam_of_isPreconnected_frontier`).
